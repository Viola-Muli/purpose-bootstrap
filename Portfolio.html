        <p>I'm fascinated by the intersection of design and technology and how it shapes our digital experiences. From brainstorming ideas to coding and testing, I thrive on the creative process of turning concepts into reality. My goal is to create intuitive, accessible interfaces that make a positive impact on users' lives.</p>

    <h4 id="div2">Personal Traits</h4>
    <p>As a detail-oriented problem solver, I approach every project with enthusiasm and a drive to exceed expectations. I'm a strong communicator and enjoy collaborating with designers and developers to bring ideas to fruition. Outside of coding, you'll find me exploring new hiking trails or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.</p>
